###**KiTeeCoin/KiTeeCoin** is a ‚ú® _special_ ‚ú® repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

KiTeeCoin is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was inspired by the founders love for animals, especially those in a rescue or near euthanasia. The KiTeeCoin software
allows anyone to operate a node in the KiTeeCoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other 
cryptocurrencies.

##USAGE:  

To start your journey with KiTeeCoin Core, see the installation guide and the getting started tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by KiTeeCoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with KiTeeCoin-cli help, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with KiTeeCoin-cli help <command>. Alternatively, see the Bitcoin Core documentation - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

###Such ports
KiTeeCoin Core by default uses port '22556' for peer-to-peer communication that is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which defaults to port 22555 for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not expose RPC ports to the public internet.
